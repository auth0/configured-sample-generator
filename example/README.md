# Example

This is an example of usage of `configurated-sample-generator`.

Just run `npm i` + `node index.js` and go to the following url: [http://localhost:3000/auth0/configurated-sample-generator/master/create-package?path=example/&configId=23](http://localhost:3000/auth0/configurated-sample-generator/master/create-package?path=example/&configId=23).

This will download this example as a ZIP file with an added `.env` file which will have the `configId` set to 23 since we put that in the URL and one other configuration file we "got from the DB".

Enjoy!
